One of the most obvious reason is that black families tend to have more children.  They have more children than white families do, so it\u2019s hard for them to have a stable home.  Another reason is that black families tend to be more conservative.  They tend to have more restrictions on their children, like not having a child with a sexual relationship, or not having a child who has a sexual relationship with a father.  And finally, black families tend to have a lower level of education, which means they\u2019re less likely to be able to afford a home.

In the US, most students are taught in an environment that emphasizes math.  But in many Asian countries, the emphasis is more on other subjects than math, so that students are more likely to focus on other subjects.  In some Asian countries, students are also more likely to be encouraged to pursue higher education, which is also a good way to develop a strong foundation in math.  So overall, it\u2019s hard to say whether Asian students excel more in math or not, because there are many factors that affect this.  However, it\u2019s clear that Asian students are more likely to succeed in math.  So I guess the answer is that Asian students excel more in math because of the education system, and also because they\u2019re more likely to succeed in higher education.
